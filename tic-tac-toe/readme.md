# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is a basic implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using socket programming in Python and a graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter.

## Instructions : 

**1. Clone the repository** : Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
**2. Open Terminals** : Open three terminal windows. Make sure you are in the directory where you cloned the repository.

 
**3. Run the Server** : In the first terminal, run the server.py file.
 ```
     python server.py
 ```
This starts the game server.

**4. Run the Clients** : In the other two terminals, run the client.py file.
 ```
     python client.py
 ```
You now have two clients connected to the server, ready to play.

**4. Game Play** :

- The server will display the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
     
- Players can take turns making moves by clicking on the empty spaces.
     
- The game will automatically determine the winner or declare a draw.
